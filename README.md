# core-hex
This is a temporary repo, as I want to merge these APIs into other hexadecimal crates.

Last time I checked (April 2025), none of these provide in-place (single-slice):
- https://github.com/DaniPopes/const-hex
- https://github.com/nervosnetwork/faster-hex

Why not simply make a PR? Because it'll take some time before I edit all of this to fit into the conventions and design of those crates
